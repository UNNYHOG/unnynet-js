Most publishers have a forum or other outdated solutions to aggregate all players, receive feedback and bug reports. Most importantly, they use such solutions to cross-promote their new games and get many organic installs. We made a step further, creating publishing tools and gaming social features as one solution, which you can start using right now!

### Remote Game Control

UnnyNet's new feature, that lets you change the behavior and appearance of your game without requiring users to download an app update. You can add/remove/edit any data in our Admin Panel, which will be exported as json/xml and delivered to all of your clients. You can use this feature to change the balance of the game at runtime, do live events or different experiments.

### Out-of-the-box

Integration of UnnyNet is extremely easy and takes not longer than 10 minutes. All UI Windows are included and fully functional.

### Scalable

Our servers are designed to run at massive scale. UnnyNet scales automatically with your user base. We have your back, so we expect from you to focus on the game itself and make it awesome.

### Real-time Chat

Realtime chat makes it easy to power a live community. Users can chat with each other 1-on-1 and in chat channels you create. Messages can contain images, emojis, links, and other content.

### Leaderboards

Leaderboards are a great way to add a social and competitive element to any game. They're a fun way to drive competition among your players.

### Achievements

Achievements can be a great way to increase your users' engagement within your game. You can implement achievements in your game to encourage players to experiment with features they might not normally use, or to approach your game with entirely different play styles. Achievements can also be a fun way for players to compare their progress with each other and engage in light-hearted competition.

### Guilds

Players can also join long-term groups called guilds. Guilds, also known as clans, kinships or crews, are usually groups of people who are working toward a common goal in a game. A guild might emphasize raiding (progression through difficult dungeons with large groups of players) or it might focus on helping lower-level players acquire gear and experience.

### Friends

Friends are a great way to build a social community. Users can add other users to their list of friends, see who is online or when they were last online, chat together in realtime, and interact together in gameplay or collaboration.

### Visual Style
You can customize the appearance of UnnyNet in your game. Change the colors of backgrounds and fonts of UnnyNet, so it would look and feel like your game.

### Community
UnnyNet helps developers to create communities of their players right inside of their games. You don't need to send your users to facebook, forum or discord anymore. Keep your users engaged right in the game!
